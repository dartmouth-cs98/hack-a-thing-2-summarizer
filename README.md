# hack-a-thing-2-summarizer

Tyler Burnam

## Short description of what you attempted to build
I was inspired by Jon Kotz's hack project last week related to summarizing text - it's a problem I've often thought about. I found this tutorial https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2018/11/introduction-text-summarization-textrank-python/ and followed it in Python. Using cosine distance of word embeddings from the GLOVE data set, I was able to write an AI that summarizes text using an extraction method. Further, I interoped the Python compute process with Node using sockets and Redis, which allowed for seamless integration into Node services.

## What you learned
I learned about writing ML algorithms from scratch, albeit quite simple and from a tutorial. I also learned about Redis and Kue, which will certainly become a staple in my workflow.

## How does this hack-a-thing inspire you or relate to your possible project ideas?
Using Redis allows for really efficient and clean distributed computing for CPU intensive tasks. I would like to have a strong distributed element to my project and Redis will likely be key.

## What didnâ€™t work
I really wanted to get a POST route set up instead of the current solution (modifying the text field of a CSV file on the machine). However, it will be an easy addition at a later date
